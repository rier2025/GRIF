## 9. Violations, Unauthorized Use, and Moral Compensation





All components of this repository — including but not limited to glyph sets, emotional-symbolic mappings, recursive scripts, interaction layers, iconographic systems, transformation paths, and symbolic metadata, user metadata — are considered integral to the GRIF system.





Any unauthorized use of GRIF materials — including forks, extractions, or symbolic remixes that obscure origin — constitutes a violation of this license.


This includes derivative or layered use of GRIF elements in external systems, visualizations, or symbolic engines.





Violations include:





- Use of GRIF elements in external symbolic systems without attribution  


- Extraction or remixing of core mechanics in a way that erases origin  


- Commercial repackaging, AI ingestion, or parasitic adaptation





**Consequences may include:**





- Immediate revocation of usage rights  


- Takedown requests for derivative or infringing materials  


- Public blacklisting from future co-creation or licensing  


- Transfer of all revenue, cryptocurrency, or financial assets gained through unauthorized GRIF use to rier2025





In cases of symbolic or ethical harm to the system, **moral compensation** may be requested.  


This may take the form of:





- Public acknowledgment and clarification of misuse  


- Symbolic restoration via new interpretive or structural contribution  


- Financial restitution proportional to the symbolic and systemic damage caused

## 10. AI Training & Embedding Restrictions





You MAY NOT:





   Train, fine-tune, or embed GRIF glyphs, definitions, or emotional logic into any AI system (LLM, multimodal model, symbolic engine, etc.) without prior review and written approval by rier2025


   Use GRIF content as part of prompt injection datasets, recursive logic modeling, symbolic language corpora, or affective computing frameworks


   Deploy glyph recognition or modulation systems without preserving author-defined emotional meaning and containment logic





Requests for training or embedding must include:


   A technical description of the system


   Intended use of glyphic structures


   Emotional/symbolic containment strategy


   Attribution method





Any unapproved use of GRIF within AI systems will be considered a violation of this license, subject to legal, symbolic, and structural consequences.





Violations may result in:





   Immediate revocation of all access and usage rights





   Formal takedown requests





   Symbolic compensation demands, including public restoration





   Transfer of financial gain to rier2025 as restitution
